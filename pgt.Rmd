I completed my BSc in Psychology from the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk), UK in 2018 where my main area or study was social psychology. For my undergraduate dissertation I was upervised by Dr. Helena Paterson and we studied factors that influence the development of a child's implicit gender stereotypes, with a specific interest in parental influence. I am currently a PGT student in [Research Methods of Psychological Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/psychologicalscienceresearchmethodsof/) where I have shifted my focus to study how children perceive peers with visible intellectual disabilities in addition to exploring new and fun ways to study children's attitudes.
