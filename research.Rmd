### Human Cognition, Representation, and Development of Dynamic Social Events. 
Our every-day world changes constantly, resulting in a dynamic tapestry of events that we must somehow make sense of and interact with. Of the most interesting signals in our dynamic world, are the social signals that allow us to interact with other humans. It seems that the process by which we attribute personality traits, emotions, motivations and intentions is effortless and unconscious. This has lead to some interesting demonstrations whereby non-human animated objects can appear to have the same qualities as humans. This raises the question, how are dynamic social events represented by the human cognitive system. More importantly, how do we develop our representations of social events and the accompanying stereotypes and biases?

### Gender stereotypes.
My dissertation is looking at the development of attitudes in children and their parents. Specifically, I am looking gender stereotypes in children and the influence their parents stereotypes have on this. I am carrying out my research in the Riverside Museum in Glasgow.

### Uncanny Valley

The Uncanny Valley phenomenon is the creepy or unsettling feeling that we experience when exposed to a robot with a certain degree of human-like characteristics. Current research indicates that the phenomenon develops throughout childhood, as young children do not find human-like robots to be more weird or creepy than machine-like robots. However, the Uncanny Valley is under-researched in children and further exploration is needed. Our study will replicate and modify Brink, Gray & Wellman’s study (2017) where children will watch videos of two different robots and answer questions about their perception of the robot.

### Perception of visible intellectual disabilities

It is important to explore the attitudes of children towards their peers with Intellectual Disabilities (IDs) in order to guide the integration and acceptance of these individuals within social and educational settings. The use of integrated, rather than segregated, educational classes in primary schools has been found to promote positive attitudes of non-disabled children towards their peers with Down Syndrome. These findings highlight the need to establish a valid and reliable measure of assessing the implicit attitudes of individuals towards people with Down Syndrome, and in particular the attitudes of primary school age children, due to this being such an influential stage in their lives. We will tap into different layers of stigma against children with ID by studying neurotypical children’s implicit attitudes towards ID peers and their playmate choice based on perceived facial similarity.
