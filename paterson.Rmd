In September 2003 I started a 3-year British Academy Post-Doctoral Fellowship, and previously I completed a PhD Thesis in the [Department of Psychology at the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/) and worked as a Post-Doc for Dr. Frank Pollick on an ESRC funded project. Currently, I am a lecturer in the School of Psychology with a responsibility for teaching Research Methods, lecturing in Social Psychology and introducing students to the Brain.

My main interest is in Dynamic Person Perception and this covers both attribution such as first impressions, but also emotion perception and measuring attitudes. I also do pedagogical research related to learning and teaching with technology.
