## Welcome!

The Study Difference Lab is located in the [School of Psychology](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). We use innovative and fun ways to study person perception and we are especially interested in developing adaptable paradigms to study how children perceive their peers. We proudly endorse the [Open Science Community](https://osf.io) by taking our research out in communities and making our methods transparent and reproducible.
